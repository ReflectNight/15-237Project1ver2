How to play:
Use the WASD or arrow keys to move
Space bar (action key) to interact with items and characters
Use T + (0-3) to teleport to other worlds

Objective:
Go outside and make friends by giving them items they want.
Characters will give you hints on what they want, NPCs in your house will give instructions.
The game ends when you run out of turns or when you have helped all the characters.

Of Interest:
You can only pick up one item at a time.
Each character wants a different item.
Some characters have an INT barrier - only by having enough INT will you be able to talk to them.
A book is on the floor of your home to increase this stat
Some items have a STR barrier - they cannot be picked up unless you have enough STR
A set of weights lies on the floor of your home to help you increase this stat
There are many worlds in the game, use the "T" button with (0-3) to teleport to different worlds.
Each world has different people and items lying around. 



Ideas from week one:

Functions: everything in the program is basically in a function,
these functions are called at different times and in different places
to allow for smooth transaction throughout the game

Canvas: we used many features in canvas to create this game including
creation of text, rectangles, etc

Events: we implemented mouse and keyboard events to run the game.
This includes the use of WASD, Arrow keys, 0-4, 't' and space bar
Clicking on items with a mouse also is used to browse the credits/instructions/starts the game
Timer events was used to clear the screen periodically.

Sprites: This game is extremely sprite heavy: sprites were imported into the game
and later drawn using ctx.drawimage.

Objects: made this game possible, all items/npcs were objects
Special properties in the object allowed us to manipulate them more effectively

Arrays/array methods: it was possible to keep track of all items/npcs and iterate through them

Operators: were used to check relational status, etc of items
It allowed us to see if the item on hand was the item the npc you are talking to wanted.

Loops: allowed all of the npcs to be checked at once and we placed all items in the game

Conditional statements: checked for stats/movement for different types of interaction
and eventually to end the game.
